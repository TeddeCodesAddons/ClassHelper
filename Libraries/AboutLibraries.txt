These libraries are not created by me, and their info remains intact. To view the library info, open its file.
I found these libraries in WeakAuras, which in some ways can be used better than this addon.
LibRangeCheck-2.0 is currently the only library being used.
It is intended to avoid me having a nightmare looking up spells on google to find out how to check range between units.
